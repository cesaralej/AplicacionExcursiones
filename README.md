# Application for Large Group Tours

Mobile Application for accessing information from a local database
Excursiones.Viajes is looking for a mobile application their chaperones can use on their annual 80-person group tour through Europe. They complain that when looking for a specific traveler’s information, they have to look through a heavy big pile of papers which takes them a long time. They also complain that when regrouping after an activity, it is hard to know who is missing because they use a physical list. It takes time to check with the list and call out names, some names might get confused and people might confirm assistance in place of someone else. The client asks for a way to uniquely identify their travelers in order to count them or look for their information quickly. Additionally, they want their travelers to receive a NFC tagged card or wristband, a picture of their QR for the travelers to display on their phones, and a couple of QR code stickers for identification, and a website where a traveler can look for addresses or phone numbers if they manage to get lost and lose their belongings.
